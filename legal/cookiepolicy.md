# COOKIE POLICY

Last updated October 25, 2020

This Cookie Policy explains how Fast Tracks uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you use the app at https://fasttracks.netlify.app. It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

We do not use cookies to collect personal information, or in any way that could be used to identify individuals.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by Fast Tracks are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

## Why do we use cookies?

Fast Tracks uses cookies to manage your sessions. When you log in with Spotify, a cookie is set to enable authentication between your Spotify account and Fast Tracks. This cookie is then deleted. Cookies are also used to set the authentication state in the app ("logged in"). These cookies remain in your browser cache until they are deleted by your cache policy, deleted by you, or by the app when you elect to log out. Without these cookies, Fast Tracks cannot connect to your Spotify account and cannot function, as the music recommendation and playlist creation functionality is dependant on interfacing with Spotify. This use of cookies is standard and widely accepted, and frankly, there isn't an alternative web technology that allows for this functionality.

## How can I control cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. Fast Tracks uses only essential cookies and so by using the app you are agreeing to the use of all cookies. Your cookies are automatically deleted as soon as they are no longer needed. By the time you see the spinning record on the app splash page, your cookies have been deleted.

## What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. However, Fast Tracks doesn't use anything other than cookies.

## Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?

No.

## Do you serve targeted advertising?

No.

## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.

## Where can I get further information?
